# **SQL Lab**

## **Overview**

SQL Labs is a week-long comprehensive engagement module that will test your understanding of basic as well as advanced SQL concepts via a combination of timed tests and well-researched assignments. Until now, you have learned all of the SQL concepts, from basic to advanced. You have also attempted various practical case studies based on supply chain and commodities datasets. In this module, you will be testing those concepts and skills in a timed environment. You will first be tested on some SQL tests, followed by a detailed assignment.

## **Why SQL Lab?**

The aim of this module is to simulate a timed environment similar to what you face while applying for a company. You have gained enough skills to solve any SQL problem, but while applying for a job, you have to perform in a timed environment, which is the key objective of this module. 

 
You will also be expected to write scripts in a modular manner, making efficient use of CTEs, and follow all practices of writing queries that you learned earlier. 


## **steps to solve:**

The following steps summarise the manner in which you should process your thinking and visualization while writing the solution query:

1. Visualising the required output

2. Which columns will be there?

3. Which rows will be selected? Defined by the usage of filters (WHERE and HAVING)

4. What would be the granularity of the data? Defined by aggregations (GROUP BY)

5. Using CTEs or subqueries for better organization of the query

6. Validating individual sections by running them independently and validating the results

7. Combining or stitching the smaller pieces together, to obtain the entire solution

8. Checking for rows explosion while performing JOINs
